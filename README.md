# Playwright Practice Tests

This repository contains my Playwright test exercises while learning automation for React/JavaScript applications.  
It demonstrates my setup for test automation using **Playwright Test** in Node.js with VS Code.

## ‚úÖ Current Example Tests
- **Google Search Test** ‚Äì Opens Google, performs a search, asserts page title  
- **Wikipedia Search Test** ‚Äì Opens Wikipedia, searches for ‚ÄúPlaywright‚Äù, asserts page title  
- **Form Fill Demo** ‚Äì Fills a simple HTML form and submits it  

All tests are runnable locally using the Playwright Test runner.

## üìò Learning Focus (Udemy End-to-End Playwright tutorials on JavaScript & TypeScript. UI Testing, API testing, Page Objects, Cucumber, CI/CD, etc.)
While building this repository, I am actively learning:
- Introduction to Playwright and its features: multiple browsers, headless vs headed, auto-waiting, screenshots  
- Async/await patterns and test function annotations  
- Browser context and page fixtures for isolated sessions  
- Playwright configuration: `testDir`, `use` settings, retries, timeouts  
- Assertions with `expect()` and cross-browser testing  
- Locators for single and multiple elements, typing, clicking, and extracting text  
- Dynamic waits for slow-loading pages and new page events  

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del-G1tHub/playwright-demo-tests.git
