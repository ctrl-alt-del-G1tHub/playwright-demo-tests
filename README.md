# Playwright Practice Tests

This repository contains my Playwright test exercises while learning automation for React/JavaScript applications.  
It demonstrates my setup for test automation using **Playwright Test** in Node.js with VS Code.

## ✅ Current Example Tests
- **Google Search Test** – Opens Google, performs a search, asserts page title  
- **Wikipedia Search Test** – Opens Wikipedia, searches for “Playwright”, asserts page title  
- **Form Fill Demo** – Fills a simple HTML form and submits it  

All tests are runnable locally using the Playwright Test runner.

## 📘 Learning Focus (Udemy End-to-End Playwright tutorials on JavaScript & TypeScript. UI Testing, API testing, Page Objects, Cucumber, CI/CD, etc.)
While building this repository, I am actively learning:
This repository tracks my progress in mastering Playwright for modern web automation, focusing on real-world skills relevant to React/JavaScript applications.

Key Areas of Learning:
✅ Handling dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, and assertions
✅ Managing child windows, tabs, and frames
✅ Debugging with Inspector & Codegen tools
✅ Using traces, reports, logs, and screenshots for test results
✅ End-to-end test flows: dynamic product selection, order placement, order history validation
✅ Advanced locator strategies: getByRole, getByText, getByLabel, chaining
✅ Calendar handling and hidden element validation
✅ API + UI hybrid testing (Playwright request methods, token injection, intercepting requests/responses)
✅ Visual testing & screenshot comparisons
✅ ExcelJS for data-driven tests, file upload/download automation
✅ Page Object Model (POM) structure with reusable methods
✅ Parameterization & fixtures for flexible test runs
✅ Configurations: retries, parallel execution, mobile emulation, SSL settings
✅ Reporting with HTML & Allure
✅ CI/CD: Integration with Jenkins
